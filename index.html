         <h3>EXT. PHOENIX, ARIZONA - DAY - HELICOPTER SHOT</h3>
         <p>
      Above Midtown section of the city. It is early afternoon, a hot mid-summer day. 
      The city is sun-blanched white and its drifted-up noises are muted in their own 
      echoes. We fly low, heading in a downtown direction, passing over traffic-clogged 
      streets, parking lots, white business buildings, neatly patterned residential 
      districts. As we approach downtown section, the character of the city begins to 
      change. It is darker and shabby with age and industry. We see railroad tracks, 
      smokestacks, wholesale fruit-and-vegetable markets, old municipal buildings, empty 
      lots. The very geography seems to give us a climate of nefariousness, of back-doorness, 
      dark and shadowy. And secret.
      </p>
         <p>
      We fly lower and faster now, as if seeking out a specific location. A skinny, high 
      old hotel comes into view. On its exposed brick side great painted letters advertise  
      "Transients - Low Weekly Rates - Radio in Every Room." We pause long enough to establish  
      the shoddy character of this hotel...Its open, curtainless windows, its silent resigned
      look so characteristic of such hole-and-corner hotels. We move forward with purposefulness 
      toward a certain window. The sash is raised as high as it can go, but the shade is pulled 
      down to three or four inches of the inside sill, as if the occupants of the room within  
      wanted privacy but needed air. We are close now, so that only the lower half of the window 
      frame is in shot. No sounds come from within the room. Suddenly, we tip downward, go to 
      the narrow space between shade and sill, peep into the room.
      </p>
         <p>
      A young woman is stretched out on the mussed bed. She wears a full slip, stockings, no shoes.
      She lies in and attitude of physical relaxation, but her face, seen in the dimness of the room,
      betrays a certain inner-tension, worrisome conflicts. She is Mary CRANE, an attractive
      girl nearing the end of her twenties and her rope.
      </p>
         <p>
      A man stands beside the bed, only the lower half of his figure visible. We hold on this tableau
      for a long moment, then start forward. As we pass under the window shade,

      <div class="scene">
         <h3>INT. HOTEL ROOM - (DAY)</h3>
         <p>
      A small room, a slow fan buzzing on a shelf above the narrow bed. A card of hotel rules
      is pasted on the mirror above the bureau. An unopened suitcase and a woman's large,
      straw open-top handbag are on the bureau. On the table beside the bed there are a container
      of Coca-Cola and an unwrapped, untouched egg-salad sandwich. There is no radio.
      </p>
         <p>
      The man standing by the bed, wearing only trousers, T-shirt and sox, is Sam LOOMIS,
      a good-looking, sensual shirt man with warm humorous eyes and a compelling smile. He is
      blotting his neck and face with a thin towel, and is staring down at Mary, a small sweet
      smile playing about his mouth. Mary keep her face turned away from him. After a moment,
      Sam drops the towel, sits on the bed, leans over and takes Mary into his arms, kisses her
      long and warmly, holds her with a firm possessiveness. The kiss is disturbed and finally
      interrupted by the buzzing closeness of an inconsiderate fly. Sam smiles, pulls away enough
      to allow Mary to relax again against the pillow. He studies her, frowns at her unresponsiveness,
      then speaks in a low, intimate, playful voice.
      </p>
         <p>
      Mary looks at his smile, has to respond, pulls him to her, kisses him. Then, and without 
      breaking the kiss, she swings her legs over the side of the bed, toe-searches around, finds her 
      shoes, slips her feet into searches them. And finally pulls away and sits up.
      </p>
         <p>
      He breaks off, his cheeriness dissolved, goes to the window, tries to raise the shade.
      It sticks. He pulls at it. It comes down entirely, and the hot sun glares into the room,
      revealing it in all its shabbiness and sordidness as if corroborating Mary's words and attitude.
      Sam kicks at the fallen shade, laughs in frustration, grabs on to his humor again.
      </p>
         <p>
        Marion exits a commercial building. Her demeanor is rushed. She glances around nervously and walks quickly to her parked car.
      </p>
         <p>
        She gets in, starts the engine, and pulls out into light traffic.
      </p>
         <p>
      She stares at him, surprised at his willingness to continue the affair on her terms, as girls
      are so often surprised when they discover men will continue to want them even after the sexual
      bait has been pulled in. Sam smiles reassuringly, places his hands gently on her arms, speaks
      with gentle and simple sincerity.
      </p>
         <p>
      He moves away and again the weight of his pain and problems crushes away his good humor. There
      is a quiet moment.
      </p>
         <p>
      He looks at her, long, pulls her close, kisses her lightly, looks out the window and stares at
      the wide sky.
      </p>
         <p>
      Mary goes out quickly, closing door behind her. As Sam stares down at his shoeless feet,

            <strong>Sam:</strong>
            <br/>Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.</p>

            <strong>Mary:</strong>
            <br/>What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Sam:</strong>
            <br/>We could laze around here a while longer.</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Mary:</strong>
            <br/>Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...<br/>Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Sam:</strong>
            <br/>I've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. They say it...</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Mary:</strong>
            <br/>When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Sam:</strong>
            <br/>You sure talk like a girl who's been married.</p>

            <br/>Sam!</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Sam:</strong>
            <br/>I'm sorry, Mary.<br/>My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.</p>
         <p class="dialogue">

         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Mary:</strong>
            <br/>This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Sam:</strong>
            <br/>Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Mary:</strong>
            <br/>I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Sam:</strong>
            <br/>And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy!</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Mary:</strong>
            <br/>It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Sam:</strong>
            <br/>You can't laugh at it, huh?</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Mary:</strong>
            <br/>Can you?</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Sam:</strong>
            <br/>Sure. It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but...</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Sam:</strong>
            <br/>And besides, when you say I make tax-deductible excuses you make me out a criminal.</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Mary:</strong>
            <br/>You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Sam:</strong>
            <br/>I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.<br/>Next best thing to no conscience at all.</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Mary:</strong>
            <br/>I have to go, Sam.</p>
         <p class="dialogue">

            <br/>I can come down next week.</p>

            <br/>No.</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Sam:</strong>
            <br/>Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Mary:</strong>
            <br/>We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Sam:</strong>
            <br/>And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Mary:</strong>
            <br/>Sam! No!</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Sam:</strong>
            <br/>All right.</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Sam:</strong>
            <br/>Mary, whenever it's possible, tax-deductible or not, I want to see deductible you. And under any conditions.<br/>Even respectability.</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Mary:</strong>
            <br/>You make respectability sound... disrespectful.</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Sam:</strong>
            <br/>I'm all for it! It requires patience and temperance and a lot of sweating-out... otherwise, though, it's only hard work.<br/>But if I can see you, touch you even as simply as this... I won't mind.</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Sam:</strong>
            <br/>I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Mary:</strong>
            <br/>I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Sam:</strong>
            <br/>A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever remarries, the alimony stops... and then...</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Mary:</strong>
            <br/>I haven't even been married once yet!</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Sam:</strong>
            <br/>Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Mary:</strong>
            <br/>Sam, let's go get married.</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Sam:</strong>
            <br/>And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps.</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Mary:</strong>
            <br/>I'll lick the stamps.</p>
         <p class="dialogue">
            <strong>Sam:</strong>
            <br/>You know what I'd like? A clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on. And the wherewithal to buy what I'd like.<br/>Mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.</p>

      A small, moderately successful office off the main street. A cab pulls up at the curb.

         <h3>INT. OUTER OFFICE - (DAY)</h3>
         <p>
      Mary enters office, crosses to her desk, sits down, rubs her temples, finally looks over at
      Caroline, a girl in the last of her teens
      </p>
         <p>
      She rises, starts for Mary's desk, pills in hand.
      </p>
         <p>
      She breaks off, distracted by the sound of the door opening. Mr. Lowery and his oil-lease client,
      Tom Cassidy, enter the office. Lowery is a pleasant, worried-faced man, big and a trifle pompous.
      Cassidy is loud and a bit drunk. He is gross, exuding pitiful vulgarity.
      </p>
         <p>
      Lowery flashes an embarrassed smile at Mary, tries to lead Cassidy toward the private office.
      </p>
         <p>
      Cassidy pauses beside Mary's desk, hooks a haunch onto the desktop, smiles a wet smile at Mary.
      </p>
         <p>
      Mary glances, cannot bring herself to smile or make a remark, continues sorting out the deed
      copies, tries to ignore the man's closeness.
      </p>
         <p>
      He takes two bundles of new $100 bills from his pocket and throws them onto the desk under Mary's
      nose. Caroline's eyes go wide. Cassidy leans close, flicks through the bills, laughs.
      </p>
         <p>
      He rises, reels toward Lowery's office, pauses, turns, speaks to Mary.
      </p>
         <p>
      Lowery starts after him, pauses, turns to Mary. Cassidy has gone into Lowery's office.
      </p>
