# About 
This repository contains of the final project for the _Information Science and Cultural Heritage (I.C.)(LM)_ course, academic year 2024/2025 of [_Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge_](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/DigitalHumanitiesKnowledge), at Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna. 

# The project 
The project focuses on creating structured data starting from an initial concept and its related items, including both a web-page documentation and a series of related files. 
We decided to focus on **Alfred Hitchcock's idea of suspance**, documenting the process on a web page [hitchcockpresentssuspance.it](https://hitchcockpresentsuspance.my.canva.site/) and uploading all the files on this Github repository.

### Repository contents 
In this repository we uploaded: 
- A folder containing the 10 .csv describing the items [csv_folder](https://github.com/chiarapicardii/hitchcock_project/tree/main/csv_folder)
- A folder containing Psycho's script enctyption: both XML/TEI and its trasnformation to HTML [Psycho encryption (XML\TEI, HTML)](https://github.com/chiarapicardii/hitchcock_project/tree/main/Psycho%20encryption%20(XML%5CTEI%2C%20HTML)
- A folder containing the .csv trasformation to RDF, with the Python script and the Turtle (.ttl) file produced [from_csv_to_RDF](https://github.com/chiarapicardii/hitchcock_project/tree/main/from_csv_to_RDF)
- A folder containing the XML/TEI transformation to RDF, with the Python script and the Turtle (.ttl) file produced [from_xml\tei_to_RDF](https://github.com/chiarapicardii/hitchcock_project/tree/main/from_xml%5Ctei_to_RDF)
- An image, produced with the Grafoo application, representing graphically the conceptual model [conceptual.jpg](https://github.com/chiarapicardii/hitchcock_project/blob/main/conceptual.jpg)
