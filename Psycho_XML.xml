      <heading>EXT. PHOENIX, ARIZONA - DAY - HELICOPTER SHOT</heading>
      <description>
      Above Midtown section of the city. It is early afternoon, a hot mid-summer day. 
      The city is sun-blanched white and its drifted-up noises are muted in their own 
      echoes. We fly low, heading in a downtown direction, passing over traffic-clogged 
      streets, parking lots, white business buildings, neatly patterned residential 
      districts. As we approach downtown section, the character of the city begins to 
      change. It is darker and shabby with age and industry. We see railroad tracks, 
      smokestacks, wholesale fruit-and-vegetable markets, old municipal buildings, empty 
      lots. The very geography seems to give us a climate of nefariousness, of back-doorness, 
      dark and shadowy. And secret.
      </description>
      <description>
      We fly lower and faster now, as if seeking out a specific location. A skinny, high 
      old hotel comes into view. On its exposed brick side great painted letters advertise  
      "Transients - Low Weekly Rates - Radio in Every Room." We pause long enough to establish  
      the shoddy character of this hotel...Its open, curtainless windows, its silent resigned
      look so characteristic of such hole-and-corner hotels. We move forward with purposefulness 
      toward a certain window. The sash is raised as high as it can go, but the shade is pulled 
      down to three or four inches of the inside sill, as if the occupants of the room within  
      wanted privacy but needed air. We are close now, so that only the lower half of the window 
      frame is in shot. No sounds come from within the room. Suddenly, we tip downward, go to 
      the narrow space between shade and sill, peep into the room.
      </description>
      <description>
      A young woman is stretched out on the mussed bed. She wears a full slip, stockings, no shoes.
      She lies in and attitude of physical relaxation, but her face, seen in the dimness of the room,
      betrays a certain inner-tension, worrisome conflicts. She is Mary CRANE, an attractive
      girl nearing the end of her twenties and her rope.
      </description>
      <description>
      A man stands beside the bed, only the lower half of his figure visible. We hold on this tableau
      for a long moment, then start forward. As we pass under the window shade,

      <heading>INT. HOTEL ROOM - (DAY)</heading>
      <description>
      A small room, a slow fan buzzing on a shelf above the narrow bed. A card of hotel rules
      is pasted on the mirror above the bureau. An unopened suitcase and a woman's large,
      straw open-top handbag are on the bureau. On the table beside the bed there are a container
      of Coca-Cola and an unwrapped, untouched egg-salad sandwich. There is no radio.
      </description>
      <description>
      The man standing by the bed, wearing only trousers, T-shirt and sox, is Sam LOOMIS,
      a good-looking, sensual shirt man with warm humorous eyes and a compelling smile. He is
      blotting his neck and face with a thin towel, and is staring down at Mary, a small sweet
      smile playing about his mouth. Mary keep her face turned away from him. After a moment,
      Sam drops the towel, sits on the bed, leans over and takes Mary into his arms, kisses her
      long and warmly, holds her with a firm possessiveness. The kiss is disturbed and finally
      interrupted by the buzzing closeness of an inconsiderate fly. Sam smiles, pulls away enough
      to allow Mary to relax again against the pillow. He studies her, frowns at her unresponsiveness,
      then speaks in a low, intimate, playful voice.

      <description>
      Mary looks at his smile, has to respond, pulls him to her, kisses him. Then, and without 
      breaking the kiss, she swings her legs over the side of the bed, toe-searches around, finds her 
      shoes, slips her feet into searches them. And finally pulls away and sits up.

      He breaks off, his cheeriness dissolved, goes to the window, tries to raise the shade.
      It sticks. He pulls at it. It comes down entirely, and the hot sun glares into the room,
      revealing it in all its shabbiness and sordidness as if corroborating Mary's words and attitude.
      Sam kicks at the fallen shade, laughs in frustration, grabs on to his humor again.

      She stares at him, surprised at his willingness to continue the affair on her terms, as girls
      are so often surprised when they discover men will continue to want them even after the sexual
      bait has been pulled in. Sam smiles reassuringly, places his hands gently on her arms, speaks
      with gentle and simple sincerity.

      He moves away and again the weight of his pain and problems crushes away his good humor. There
      is a quiet moment.

        <character>Sam</character>
        <line>I'm fed up with sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he's in his grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere.</line>
